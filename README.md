# Raw Sequence Data QA/QC
scripts for assessing the quality of your NGS data!
* To see a rarefraction curve analysis (to assess if more sequencing is needed) see [here](https://gist.github.com/MolEcolConsLab/82deca8289136b41357b02f6a79f9404)
  * this script was used for RNA-seq data but the subsamling method can be used for any type of sequence data
  * you will just need to adjust the diversity metric (y-axis of the curve) to be appropriate for your analyses (reads mapped to genome, variants found, etc.) 
* To see a pipeline for trimming with sickle and scythe see [here](https://gist.github.com/MolEcolConsLab/b74cdddf1f7a98fcfd516ac258ca7c04)
